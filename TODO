- instead of relay connecting directly to clipboards, it connects to RelayNodes
- RelayNode can either be a LocalRelayNode (which would hold an instance of
  (clipboard), or a RemoteRelayNode, which would hold an instance of a websocket
- a remote RelayNode, would process an incoming message, and always want to send
  chunks to it. pretty sure i can do that with the iterator protocol, local one
  will always generate a ChunkedMessage with the data fully initialized
- argh this is gonna be a huge refactoring :(
